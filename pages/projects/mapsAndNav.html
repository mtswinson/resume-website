              The Maps and Navigation project was a customer-facing tool designed to help advisors guide users to their
              destinations safely and efficiently. I joined the project early in its development, contributing to both
              frontend and backend functionality. The interface centered around an interactive map that displayed
              real-time data including points of interest, traffic disruptions, weather alerts, and evacuation routes.
              Advisors could toggle map layers, search for destinations, and locate nearby services such as hotels, gas
              stations, hospitals, restaurants, and service stations. The tool was built to support both everyday
              navigation and emergency scenarios, ensuring customers had access to reliable routing and situational
              awareness.

            <p>
              General Motors needed a system that enabled advisors to assist customers with navigation in real time. The
              tool had to support:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Route planning from current location or between two points</li>
              <li>Identification of nearby services based on vehicle location</li>
              <li>Visualization of road events, traffic, and weather crises</li>
              <li>Emergency routing via evacuation paths</li>
              <li>Real-time updates and contextual awareness of affected areas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The goal was to improve customer safety, reduce travel disruptions, and give advisors the tools to respond
              quickly and accurately in both routine and crisis situations.

              I worked as a full-stack developer, contributing across UI, logic, backend services, and testing
              infrastructure. The stack included React for the frontend, API's for data handling, and a map rendering
              engine using third party services. I navigated a large and evolving codebase, often working across
              multiple packages and coordinating with other developers to implement features, resolve bugs, test new and
              legacy functionality, and support refactoring efforts.

              <li>Selected Search Result Marker</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implemented bidirectional highlighting between the map and search panel. When a user clicked a search
                  result, the corresponding map icon would enlarge, turn purple, and gain a dark purple outline.
                  Clicking the map icon would trigger the same visual treatment for the related search result. This
                  required cross-component communication and careful state synchronization across multiple layers of the
                  repository.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Weather Alert Details Panel</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Built a new route and component to display weather alert details in the left pane when a weather icon
                  was clicked. This extended the interaction model from the previous feature and involved creating new
                  UI elements and routing logic.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Accessibility Enhancements</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added labelling to all actionable elements within various packages throughout the repository. This
                  improved accessibility and laid the foundation for more reliable automated testing.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Typography Refactor</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Converted legacy typography elements to an internally developed typography component across assigned
                  packages. This involved assessing each instance, applying the correct format, and testing for visual
                  consistency. Some cases required creative solutions due to format mismatches.

              <li>Unit Testing Improvements</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Strengthened unit test coverage using the newly added labels and Typography component. This improved
                  pipeline reliability and helped catch regressions introduced by future changes.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developed logic to automatically enable the evacuation routes layer to display all relevant evacuation
                  routes on the map if a crisis was detected within a 30-mile radius of the route and the relevant flag
                  was active.

              <li>Change Format of Zoom Level Alert</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Customized the appearance of toast messages triggered by zoom level changes to match Salesforceâ€™s
                  color palette. This involved overriding default toast styling, sourcing color codes, and applying them
                  manually. The toast system resisted custom styling, requiring multiple iterations before the desired
                  look was achieved.
                </li>

              <li>Create Auto Update Location Activity</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Built backend logic to log vehicle location history during automatic updates. Each entry captured the
                  update interval and whether the trigger was user-initiated or system-driven. Initial implementation
                  used useState, which reset on rerender. I refactored the logic using scoped variables and context to
                  maintain state across updates.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Correcting Toast Error Message</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Updated the error message in toast notifications and verified translation keys. This echoed early work
                  I did on the Advisor Workbench and helped close out lingering issues in the backlog.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Digital Twin Failover</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developed a fallback mechanism for location services, allowing the system to revert to legacy calls if
                  the desired service failed. Simulating failure conditions was inconsistent, and location updates
                  sometimes bypassed both services. Final implementation was abandoned due to business changing
                  directions.

              The tool gave advisors a centralized interface for navigation and crisis response, improving customer
              safety and service quality. Features like evacuation route logic, bidirectional UI interactions, and
              contextual weather alerts improved usability and safety. My work on accessibility, typography, and testing
              also contributed to long-term maintainability and reliability across the codebase.

              This was the most complex and formative project I worked on at General Motors. It deepened my experience
              in full-stack development, and showed that all of my hard work and training had put me one step closer to
              being the best that I can be at what I do and a powerhouse in the workforce.
