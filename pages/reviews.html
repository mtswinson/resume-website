                        of the application. Matt made significant contributions to the development of the Alerts Admin
                        Portal which will be released to production in the coming weeks. This is a significant
                        achievement for the Firebirds team, as it marks their first production deployment since joining
                        the Emer ART. The application was primarily developed by the Firebirds team, showcasing their
                        end-to-end involvement in the project. It was an amazing accomplishment for the team as a whole
                        and Matt can be proud of his contributions to the effort."

                        different scenarios to test them out. Your feedback helped us discover gaps in the current model
                        that need to be addressed as the business team works on forming a revised hybrid strategy for
